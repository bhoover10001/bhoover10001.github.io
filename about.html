title: About Me
---

<p>I've been a programmer for a while.  I know that it's a cliche, but I started programming on a IBM machine with 2k of memory.  
Over the years, obviously programming styles have changed.  I've learned a lot of languages, most of which are now obsolete and forgotten.
(APL anyone?).  Mostly, I'm a full stack engineer, and on any given day, I will be working on SQL, Java and JavaScript.  
It gets a little confusing trying to remember all of the different systems.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've had lots of amazing opportunities, from studying in Germany, to teaching at the University of Phoenix, to 
working with some of the most amazing people.  I've managed teams from 2 to 50 people.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm a consultant working on a couple of legacy applications.  Over the last year, I've written more than 3000 unit tests
and 300 Selenium scenario tests, while also adding new features to these applications</p>
